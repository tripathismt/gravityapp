after downloading the code from the git hub you have to install NPM package first 
to intall open terminal and give command
-> npm install

after that you need to install the google map api 
for that you have to give the following command in the terminal
-> npm i @react-google-maps/api

for working the app properly you have to give a GOOGLE MAP API KEY 
in that i have used developer api that why we can not get the functioning to make it functional you hava to use you own API KEY (billed API KEY)
so For proper functioning use you Own API key
